# OngoingGame
## Description
A simple (currently console-based) game with no real goal for me to familiarize myself with TDD, large projects, and C# in general.

## Planning
### What is it about?
Currently the game will be console based, receiving inputs from the user to do simple dungeon raiding, interacting with NPCs, fighting, and leveling up.
